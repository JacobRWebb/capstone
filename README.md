# CS 4920 Frontend Capstone project

This project consists of two parts. The [Frontend](https://github.com/JacobRWebb/capstone) `Currently Viewing` and the [Backend Server](https://github.com/vshultz/SeniorProject2021)

## Info

The frontend project was made using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). The reason my team and I decided to choose NextJS is because of the built-in Routing and Server-Side rendering it offers right out of the box.

## Getting Started

- Ensure you have [Node.JS installed](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Now install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) using the following console command

```bash
  npm install -g yarn
```

- Navigate to the frontend root directory and run the following console command

```bash
  yarn
```

- Once the node_modules are done downloading. Start the server by running.

```bash
  yarn next
```

- Open http://localhost:3000
